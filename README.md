# /r/fakealbumcovers frontpage image scraper

Motivated by laziness, I wrote a scraper that will download all album covers  
on the frontpage of [r/fakealbumcovers](https://reddit.com/r/fakealbumcovers)

## Installation
> Requires Node v7.6 or above

1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/aos/alcoves.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
3. Change the desired download path (`index.js`: line `44`)
```
dest: '../../../../Pictures/covers'
```
